# Maze

This program was written for a class project with a team of 4 other students. Our job was to program a LEGO Mindstorms Robot to travel through a maze, which we did using sensors to detect the path outlined in the maze, to tell where walls were using a touch sensor and move accordingly, and motors to navigate left, right, forward, and backward. On my team, I was repsonsible for debugging code and implementing a stack to keep track of the steps the reobot took to navigate through the maze and use them to travel from the finish line back to the start.
