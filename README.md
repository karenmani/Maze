# Maze

This program was written for a class project with a team of 4 other students. Our job was to program a LEGO Mindstorms Robot to travel through a maze, which we did using sensors to detect the path outlined in the maze, to tell where walls were using a touch sensor and move accordingly, and motors to navigate left, right, forward, and backward.
